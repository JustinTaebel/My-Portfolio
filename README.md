<h1>Justin Taebel - Software Engineer Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>
I created this portfolio so potential employers could have an easier time understanding more of who I am and what I can bring to a company.
I wanted to show off my front-end development skills with this visually pleasing and interactive website. It is also fully responsive so it works on mobile devices with no issues. Created from scratch using HTML and CSS.<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
I provide multiple sections that give a better understanding of who I am including a skills, projects, about me, and contact section. Skills section lists some tools that I know how to use and a short description on how I've used these tools. Project section lists 4 projects that I am proud of with either a link to the github page or a demo video. If you click on one of these github pages, there is a link to the hosted website on the right hand side of the page. About me section tells a little about what I am passionate about and my experience. The contact section tells how you can reach me.
